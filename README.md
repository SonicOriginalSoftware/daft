# The Solution

## What is this?

Have you been looking for a place to throw your git repositories that isn't in the cloud - kept on-prem?

But you also need an automated CI/CD solution?

And an issue tracker?

And artifact hosting?

And ...

And GitLab is taking too long to implement even the most basic of features?

Look no further. The Solution is here!

## Are you full of yourself?

Really, I'm not. I couldn't think of a good name and I wanted to jump straight into implementing rather than figure out what FOTM single-word trendy name would suit this system.

## Migration to Deno

Once Deno wraps up http2 and runs on ARM64/musl, this project will migrate to using Deno over nodejs.

## Dogfood

This project is hosted on GitHub because I don't trust my home ISP to reliably serve this repository. The cloud can still be a good solution for certain problems.
