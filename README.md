# Daft

# What is this?

Have you been looking for a place to throw your code repositories (cloud or on-prem) and finding the current options lackluster?

But you also need an automated CI/CD solution?

And an issue tracker?

And artifact hosting?

And ...

And would like a solution that is completely modular in nature?

And GitLab is taking too long to implement even the most basic of features?

Look no further. The solution is here!

# Are you full of yourself?

Really, I'm not. I couldn't think of a good name and I wanted to jump straight into implementing rather than figure out what FOTM single-word trendy name would suit this system.

# Dogfood

This project is hosted on GitHub because I don't trust my home ISP to reliably serve this repository. The cloud can still be a good solution for certain problems.

Once the codebase and orchestration are more fully implemented I may look into hosting through a cloud provider.
