# General

Each of the components can be used and grouped arbitrarily and managed through the `portal`.

For example, you can create a portal service for yourself and one for your company.

You can then integrate the wiki component for both your personal and company portal services.

And keep a top-level issue-tracker component available for your company portal service.

Then create project groups for your company for an operating system and one for a web app framework.

In the web app framework group, integrate the key-vault and artifact-repository components that can be shared amidst all of the framework code repositories.

Then add a sub-group of the web app framework for tooling, integrate a key-vault specifically for that group, along with the code-repository component, automation, and issue tracking.
